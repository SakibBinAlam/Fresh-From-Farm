## Fresh-From-Farm
### Project Description
The database system stores information about farmers, their products (crops), and customers. Through this system farmers can sell their crops to the customers without the hassle of the middleman. This will ensure the perfect profit they deserve for their hard work. On the other hand, customers will get fresh food directly from farmers. The system will give the information about available crops, their prices, related farmers, the address of farmers and customers, total sales records, etc.
